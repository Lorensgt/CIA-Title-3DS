# CIA-Title-3DS
A simple script to extract the name of 3DS roms in .cia format. Information extracted from http://www.3dsdb.com.

If you have roms with a not too descriptive name and do not want to install a .cia file (with its time expenditure) to know what title it is, you can use this script and identify the rom. It does not work with DLC.

Example:
```
ciaid.py you_path_roms
```
